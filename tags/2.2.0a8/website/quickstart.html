<h2>Quickstart Guide</h2>
<p>
Welcome to TVRename!
<p>
This is a quick guide to get you going.  For more information, please refer to the user guide link below.  This page can always be accessed by going to the Help menu, and choosing "Quickstart Guide".
<p>
Here are the basic steps you need:
<p>
(1) Go to the "Folder Monitor" tab.  This will let you add a lot of folders quickly, and semi-automatically.  You can also manually add shows you are interested in (even if they don't have a folder on disk somewhere) on the "My Shows" tab.
<p>
(2) Go to the "My Shows" tab and browse the series and episode information for your shows.
<p>
(3) Go to the "Rename" tab, and hit "Check".  This will check your collection and suggest new names for your files, based on information downloaded from thetvdb.com.
<p>
(4) Go to the "Missing" tab, and hit "Check".  This will tell you which episodes are missing from your collection.
<p>
(5) Go to the "When to watch" tab.  This shows all known future airdates of shows you are interested in.
<p>
Whatever manipulation TVRename does to your files, it will never change the season or episode number. If the names get screwed up, the season and episode number will be unchanged.  This means that the problem should be (fairly easily) fixable after changing some settings, or adding new rules.
