<h2>Quickstart Guide</h2>
<p>
Welcome to TVRename!
<p>
This is a quick guide to help get you going.  This page can always be accessed by going to the Help menu, and choosing "Quickstart Guide".
<p>
Here are the basic steps you need to do:
<p>
(1) Go to <b>Tools</b>&gt;<b>Folder Monitor</b>.  This will let you add a lot of folders quickly, and semi-automatically.  After setting where the base of your media library is, tell it to "Check", then do a "Auto ID All".  TVRename will scan your media library, and match up show names against TheTVDB, and also guess if you have a "flat" structure with all your seasons in one folder, or separated out.  When finished, click "Add & Close" to add all identified folders to "My Shows".
<p>
You can manually add shows one-by-one (even if they don't have a folder on disk somewhere) by clicking the "Add" button at the bottom of the "My Shows" tab.  Enter the show name, and click search to find it's ID code.  Enter the base folder for the show in your media library, and select whether or not you have a sub-folder for each season.
<p>
(2) Go to the "My Shows" tab and browse the series and episode information for your shows.  You can edit the show itself to control how TVRename manages that particular show, or edit a season to override the episode information fetched from TheTVDB.
<p>
(3) In <b>Options</b>&gt;<b>Preferences</b>, go to "Search Folders" and set where you download new episodes to.  Also visit <b>Options</b>&gt;<b>Filename Template Editor</b> to set how TVRename will rename your files.
<p>
(4) Go to the "Scan" tab, and click "Scan".  TVRename will download any show information needed from TheTVDB, and check your media library.  You can control what actions will be performed by clicking "Options..." before doing a scan.
<p>
(5) After a scan, review the suggested changes and other information.  Any ticked item will be actioned, so untick things you aren't sure about, or use the checkboxes in the bottom-right of the screen.  Right-click on selected items for more actions.
<p>
(6) Click "Do Checked" at the bottom of the Scan tab to have TVRename perform the ticked actions.  It will move, rename, download, etc. as necessary.
<p>
(7) Go to the "When to watch" tab to see all known future airdates of shows you are interested in.
<p>
Whatever manipulation TVRename does to your files, it will never change the season or episode number.  If the names get screwed up, the season and episode number will be unchanged.  This means that the problem should be (fairly easily) fixable after changing some settings, or adding new rules.
