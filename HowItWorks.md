# Introduction #

This "How It Works" page will have a series of links to descriptions of how the code and data structures for TVRename works and fit together.

If you're working on the code, or adding a new feature, let me (sstteevvee) know, and I'll put an initial description of how the relevant parts of TVRename work.  Edits and updates by other people are welcome, too!

# History #

This code was originally written in C++.NET, and was the first .NET program I had worked on.  As a result, some things aren't as well written as they could be, and doesn't take advantage of some of the clever .NET language features I have subsequently learnt about (or were only available in C#).  There aren't many source code comments either, as it was never originally planned to be open-sourced.  The C++ code was then converted to C#, once the bulk of the code had been written.
