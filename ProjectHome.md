# Project Description #
Automatically rename and organize your TV shows, and more!

Main website, including [forums](http://tvrename.com/bb), and help at http://tvrename.com

# Tools #
Development is done with Microsoft Visual Studio 2008, in C#.NET.  It will also compile on other versions of Visual Studio (including Express), as well as Mono.

# Development #
If you want to add features to TVRename, or fix some bugs, let me know what you want to work on and I'll give you some hints on where to start. Go to the TVRename forums, and make a post there, or add a comment to the relevant issue on the issue tracker here.  I can also be emailed tvrename -at- tvrename.com

I recommend getting one of the tagged versions from the repository as a starting point.  The main branch will be being checked into fairly frequently if I am working on it.

You can then submit patches to me, and I'll merge them in with the official code.  I can also have a look setting it up so you can commit changes directly.

# Libraries #
TVRename uses two libraries, the binaries for which are included in the repository, and referenced by the project:
  * [SourceGrid](http://www.codeplex.com/sourcegrid)
  * [DotNetZIP](http://www.codeplex.com/DotNetZip)

# Developer Documentation #
None yet, sorry.  Feel free to send me questions, and I'll steer you in the right direction.
